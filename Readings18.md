# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

- What are serverless functions?
  - A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier.
  
- If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
  - Implement various node modules that have generic functionality (ie: CRUD's) - I'd assume I'd just have to follow a minor scheme to tell it to input certain data into certain spots and that's it? I'm not too sure, TBH.

- Describe how a CDN works
  - At its core, a CDN is a network of servers linked together with the goal of delivering content as quickly, cheaply, reliably, and securely as possible. In order to improve speed and connectivity, a CDN will place servers at the exchange points between different networks.

| Cloud Storage | Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service. It’s delivered on demand with just-in-time capacity and costs, and eliminates buying and managing your own data storage infrastructure. This gives you agility, global scale and durability, with “anytime, anywhere” data access. |
