# BIG O : What is it?

- Big O() notation describes how efficient an algorithm or function runs. This is evaluated based upon 2 factors:
    - Run Time: (Time Efficiency / Complexity) meaning the amount of time it takes a function to complete.
    - Memory: (Space Efficiency / Complexity) meaning the amount of memory / resources a function takes up storing data / instructions.

    - *4 Key areas to consider when analyzing:*
        - Input Size
        - Units of Measurement
        - Orders of Growth
        - Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case
  
 ### Input Size
 - Refers to the size of the parameter values that are read by the algorithm. (**EACH PARAMETER VALUES**)
