# Bearer Authorization

Steps:
    - Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
    - Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
    - Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
    - Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
    - Make a request to the access token endpoint
    - Receive access token
    - Receive authorization code

    ----------------------- | -----------
    Client ID               | The Client ID (cid) is a unique identifier for a browserâ€“device pair 
    ----------------------- | -----------            
    Client Secret           | A client secret is a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors.

    Authentication Endpoint | Endpoint authentication is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service.
    ----------------------- | -----------
    Access Token Endpoint   | The token endpoint is where apps make a request to get an access token for a user
    ----------------------- | -----------
    API Endpoint            | An endpoint is one end of a communication channel. When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints.
