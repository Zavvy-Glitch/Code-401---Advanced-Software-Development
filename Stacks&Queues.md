# Stacks & Queues

## What is a Stack?
  - A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next node in the stack, but does not reference the previous.

### Terminology
| Push - O(1) | POP - O(1) | Top - O(1) | Peek - O(1) | isEmpty - O(1) | FILO | LIFO |
|-------------|------------|------------|-------------|----------------|------|------|
| Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed. Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack. | Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised. Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.| This is the top of the stack. | When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised. When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack. | returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false | This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack. | This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack. | Nodes or items that are added to the queue. | Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised. |


## What is a Queue?
  - Is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue.

### Terminology
| Enqueue - O(1) | Dequeue - O(1) | Front | Rear | Peek - O(1) | isEmpty - O(1) | FIFO | LILO |
|----------------|----------------|-------|------|-------------|----------------|------|------|
| Nodes or items that are added to the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised. When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation. | Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue. | This is the front/first Node of the queue. | This is the rear/last Node of the queue. | When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised. When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue. | Returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false. | This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue. | This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue. |
