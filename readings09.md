# Authorization / Authentication

1. What header(s) are used in authentication and authorization
    - Basic, followed by a space and a base64-encoded(non-encrypted) string username: password.
      - Example: Authorization: Basic AXVubzpwQDU1dzByYM==
    - Bearer Authentication‚Äù gives access to the bearer of this token. The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header while requesting to protected resources.
      - Example: Authorization: Bearer `<token>`

2. What is safe to put into a JWT?
    - JOSE Header: contains metadata about the type of token and the cryptographic algorithms used to secure its contents.
    - JWS payload (set of claims): contains verifiable security statements, such as the identity of the user and the permissions they are allowed.
    - JWS signature: used to validate that the token is trustworthy and has not been tampered with. When you use a JWT, you must check its signature before storing and using it.

3. How are JWT's validated?
    - To parse and validate a JSON Web Token (JWT), you can:
      - Use any existing middleware for your web framework.
      - Choose a third-party library from JWT.io.
      - Manually implement the checks described in [specification RFC 7519 > 7.2 Validating a JWT.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-7.2)
        - Middleware:
            - Many web frameworks, such as ASP.NET Core, include JWT middleware that handles JWT validation. Typically, this is the best route to take because the middleware integrates well with the framework's overall authentication mechanisms.
        - Third-party libraries:
            - Example: node-jsonwebtoken library => jwt.verify()
        - Manually implement checks

## Terminologies
| RBAC | User Roles | JWT Token |
| ---- | ---------- | --------- |
| An approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC) \\\ [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) | User Roles are permission sets that control access to areas and features within the Professional Archive Platform. Each User account requires a Role assignment \\\ [Source: Smarsh Central](https://central.smarsh.com/s/article/What-are-User-Roles) | JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA \\\ [Source: JWT.IO](https://jwt.io/introduction) |
