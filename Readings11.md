# Event Driven Applications

1. Why is access control important?
    - Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.

2. Describe an application that would need access control.
  - Banking Applications
  - Shopping Applications

3. What is a role used for?
  - Roles are used to assign specific users different accessabilities to an application.

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
  - They reduce the tasks of an administrator or authorities when users take on different roles in an organization and need to be assigned different access rights or privileges based on these roles. RBAC is a very expressive and flexible access control mechanism that makes it possible to have security policies based on the principle of least privilege, static and dynamic separation of duties, conflicts between roles and permissions, and many more.
