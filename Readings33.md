## ROLE BASED ACCESS CONTROL
[Notations from Digital Guardian](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-role-based-access-control-rbac-examples-benefits-and-more)
  - RBAC: What is it?
    - Restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network
    - Computer resources can be limited to specific tasks such as the ability to view, create, or modify a file
  - Examples of RBAC
    -  Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
    -  Management role group – you can add and remove members.
    -  Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
    -  Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.

### Benefits of RBAC
  - **NOTE: Access can and should be granted on a need-to-know basis.**
    - Reducing administrative work and IT support.
    - Maximizing operational efficiency.
    - Improving compliance.

### Best Practices for Implementing RBAC
  - Create a list of every software, hardware and app that has some sort of security. To include a list of server rooms under lock and key, a list of status of individuals that have access to all programs / areas.
  - Even if you do not have a formal roster and list of roles, determine what each individual team member does.
  - Any changes made need to be written for all current and future employees to see.
  - Once the current security status and roles are understood (not to mention a policy is written), make the changes.
  - Early on, you should evaluate your roles and security status frequently. Assess first, how well the creative/production process is working and secondly, how secure your process happens to be.
