# Access Control (ACL)

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
    - Basic is used upon a user is Login while bearer is implemented after.

2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?
    - Defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
    - Never store unencrypted secrets in .git repositories
    - Avoid git add * commands on git
    - Add sensitive files in .gitignore
    - Use automated secrets scanning on repositories

#### Terminologies:

| Encryption | Token | Bearer | Secret | JSON Web Token |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | -------------- |
| The process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access | A software token (a.k.a. soft token) is a piece of a two-factor authentication security device that may be used to authorize the use of computer services. Software tokens are stored on a general-purpose electronic device such as a desktop computer, laptop, PDA, or mobile phone and can be duplicated | Is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources | Refer to a private piece of information that acts as a key to unlock protected resources or sensitive information in tools, applications, containers, DevOps and cloud-native environments | An open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA |

#### PREVIEW:
    - Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
        - I knew of USER / ADMIN roles but I didn't know that it tied into RBAC or ACL
        - Other than this I knew nothing else in regards to RBAC
    - Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
        - Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
        - What other technologies can we use to control access
