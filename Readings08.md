# Access Control (ACL)

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
    - Basic is used upon a user Login to verify if they are an authentic user, while bearer is implemented after to verify the users token for access to specific content / routes.

2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?
    - Defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
    - Never store unencrypted secrets in .git repositories
    - Avoid git add * commands on git
    - Add sensitive files in .gitignore
    - Use automated secrets scanning on repositories

## Benefits of RBAC?
   - It makes it much easier to audit user rights and correct and issues that have been identified.
   - Ongoing management of access rights are much easier and more secure.
    
RBAC vs. ABAC vs. ACL
   - ACL: (Access Control List) is a means of defining access rights by a given user / user group to specific content.
   - ABAC: (Attribute-Based Access Control) a.k.a policy based access control. It can use a variety of attributes to determine if a user's access request should be granted
   - RBAC: (Role Based Access Control) is the idea of assigning system access to users based upon their role within an organization/company.

## RBAC Implementation (5 Steps)
1. Inventory your systems
    -  Figure out your rescources needed to control access. 
    -  For Example: email, customer databases, contact management systems, specific major folders / files on a server.
2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
    - Workforce members should be grouped into roles with common access needs. Avoid defining too many roles. Simple and stratified is key
3. Assign people to roles
    - Configure which types of roles each employee belongs too and set their access accordingly
4. Never make one-off changes
    - If an employee has an unusual need to change their roles, avoid making one off changes. Rather, change the role completely or add new ones if necessary.
5. Audit
    - Review your roles, the employees assigned, and the access permitted for each. If the roles have unnecessary access to a part of a system, change the role and adjsut the access level for all employees in that role.


#### Terminologies:

| Encryption | Token | Bearer | Secret | JSON Web Token |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | -------------- |
| The process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access | A software token (a.k.a. soft token) is a piece of a two-factor authentication security device that may be used to authorize the use of computer services. Software tokens are stored on a general-purpose electronic device such as a desktop computer, laptop, PDA, or mobile phone and can be duplicated | Is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources | Refer to a private piece of information that acts as a key to unlock protected resources or sensitive information in tools, applications, containers, DevOps and cloud-native environments | An open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA |
