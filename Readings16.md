# AWS: Cloud Servers

- Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
  - The process in which an HTTP request is routed. Specifically the flow of Requests/Responses made from Client to Server or vice versa
  
- Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
  - The server would be where all of data that a client has requested is stored. Dependent on how the developer has configured the route to gather up the data, the client will only be able to see what the developer intends.

- What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
  - The process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager (app manager) or software management system, to a specific URL on a server.

| Terminology | Definitions |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Server | Piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients" |
| Pub/Sub | An architectural design pattern that provides a framework for exchanging messages between publishers and subscribers. This pattern involves the publisher and the subscriber relying on a message broker that relays messages from the publisher to the subscribers |
| WRRC | First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user |
