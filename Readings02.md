## Review / Research / Discuss

1. What is the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?
  - `PUT` is used to update and existing object/resource.(This is a definite change)
  - `PATCH` is used modify an object/resource as a partial fix. (This is a partial change)

2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to "mock" an API for development like `json-server`
  - Postman
  - Stoplight
  - WireMock

3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js. Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
  - 200's are sent with successful operations
  - 400's & 500's are sent with unsuccessful operations

4. Compare and Contrast SOAP and ReST
    | SOAP | ReST |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | Simple Object Access Protocol | Representational State Transfer |
    | Consists of something called a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) which contains an XML schema to define what actions can be sent to the server | Architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web |
    
## Define the Following Terms
  - Web Server: computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP
  - Express: minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
  - Routing: a way of organizing and managing application states. A routing framework in JavaScript helps you to change the state of the application--perhaps moving from one admin panel section to another--while maintaining application persistence
  - WRRC: Web Request Response Cycle : traces how a user's request flows through the app
